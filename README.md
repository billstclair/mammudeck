[Mammudeck](https://mammudeck.com/) will be a Tweetdeck-like interface to the [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) social media platform. It will be written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), and will use the [billstclair/elm-mastodon](https://github.com/billstclair/elm-mastodon) package to handle the API.

Currently, it consists of only a static HTML place-holder page for the Mammudeck.com domain.
